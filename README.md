## Analysis Summary

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis to understand the factors influencing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Below is a summary of the key insights obtained from the analysis:

### Demographic Factors and Churn

- **Age Distribution and Churn Label:**
  - Explored the relationship between age distribution and churn label.
  - Analyzed the impact of age on average revenue and churn rates.

- **Number of Dependents and Churn:**
  - Investigated the influence of the number of dependents on average revenue and churn reasons.
  - Explored how the presence of dependents affects churn behavior.

### Contract and Service Analysis

- **Contract Distribution by Tenure:**
  - Examined the distribution of contract types based on tenure in years.
  - Identified trends in contract selection and customer retention.

- **Internet Type and Churn:**
  - Analyzed the counts of different internet types based on churn labels.
  - Investigated whether internet type influences churn behavior.

- **Service Subscriptions and Churn:**
  - Explored the count of churn labels for various services provided by the telco.
  - Identified key services with higher churn rates and potential areas for improvement.

### Revenue and Customer Lifetime Value

- **Total Revenue by Churn Label:**
  - Analyzed total revenue generated by customers based on churn labels.
  - Explored differences in revenue between churned and retained customers.

- **Total Customer Lifetime Value by Churn Label:**
  - Investigated the lifetime value of customers based on churn labels.

### Customer Satisfaction and Churn Reasons

- **Satisfaction Score by Churn Label:**
  - Explored customer satisfaction scores and their relationship with churn.
  - Identified potential reasons for customer dissatisfaction leading to churn.

- **Churn Reasons by Category:**
  - Analyzed the distribution of churn reasons across different categories.
  - Identified common reasons for churn and potential areas for improvement.

### Conclusion

Through these analyses, I gained valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By understanding these factors, businesses can develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.
